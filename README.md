### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning :computer: computer science :computer: and its applications in solving :honeybee: biological problems :whale:
### ðŸ”­ I am interested in developing biologically interpretable  :train2: machine learning :train: models for problems in :biohazard: cancer biology:biohazard:
### ðŸŒ± I have some experience in bioinformatics problem solving on the :wheel_of_dharma: [Rosalind Platform](http://rosalind.info/statistics/countries/in/) :wheel_of_dharma:

### ðŸŒ± Recent: I am applying to fall 2021 doctoral programs in biomedical science / engineering (computational biology / bioinformatics / genomics)  


### :point_down: For fun I tried implementing the Julia Set Fractal generating algorithm and made this video. I hope you'll enjoy it. :point_down:
